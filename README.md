# bobble_bigmauji (Android Assignment - Bobble Internship)

# Ques-1
• Bobble Users enjoy Bigmauji feature a lot, so bobble is planning to create a big Text.
You are tasked to create an app with an option to display text entered by the user like a
threaded conversation.
• There should be an option for the user to enter some text and a display/send button
beside it
• Once the user enters the text and press the display button, the text should be displayed
as a list above the text input box like a threaded conversation(latest should be at the
bottom).
• If the user press and hold the display button, then entered text should keep on increasing
in size (animations can be shown for the same on the screen- watch bigmouji video),
• When the user releases the button it should be displayed in the appropriate size selected
by the user and input field should be blank.
• Also when the user closes and reopens the app, previous data should be shown(Think
about user experience if the data is too much)
